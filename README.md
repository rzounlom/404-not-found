## Overview

![screenshot](./assets/img/demo.png)

- My task was to create a 404 page based on the devChallenges.io challenge
- It was nice to take a step back and get back to the basics of HTML and CSS
- I learned that it's always good to practice the fundamentals
- Thoughts: take your time and just keep building things!
